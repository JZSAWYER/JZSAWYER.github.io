Hi! I'm Haitian Zhong (仲海天, aka JZSAWYER), a senior-year undergraduate student at Cuiying Honors College[<img src='./images/chc_logo.png' style="width: 6em;">](https://cycollege.lzu.edu.cn/index.htm) (**China's Top-notch Undergraduate training program 2.0**), Lanzhou University[<img src='./images/lzu_logo.png' style="width: 4.5em;">](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I intend to **pursue my Ph.D. degree at the Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing** (CRIPAC[<img src='./images/cripac.png' style="width: 5em;">](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/CN/model/index.htm)) of the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR[<img src='./images/nlpr.png' style="width: 7em;">](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/)), the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA[<img src='./images/iacas_logo.jpg' style="width: 6.25em;">](http://english.ia.cas.cn/)), advised by Prof. [Tieniu Tan(谭铁牛)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W-FGd_UAAAAJ&hl=en)(**Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences**), co-advised by Prof. [Qiang Liu(刘强)](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) and Prof. [Shu Wu(吴书)](http://www.shuwu.name/). Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at CRIPAC.

I won **two Excellence Awards at 2022 S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest**[<img src='./images/ycmc.png' style="width: 6em;">](http://www.yau-contest.com/show-86-52.html) in the subjects of [Analysis and Partial Differential Equations (分析与微分方程)](http://yau-contest.com/uploads/file/20220811/20220811173216_22765.pdf) and [Applied and Computational Mathematics (应用数学与计算数学)](http://yau-contest.com/uploads/file/20220801/20220801162446_69325.pdf). This distinction made me **the FIRST winner ever** from Lanzhou University to be recognized in these two subjects. Additionally, I advanced to the national finals of Chinese Mathematics Competition([CMC(全国大学生数学竞赛)](http://www.cmathc.cn/)) twice.

My research interests include **Large Language Models (Factual Editing and Interpretability), Numerical Analysis (Computational PDEs), Machine Learning (Generative Models and Theory) and AI for Science (Bioinformatics)**.

Outside of research, I'm a big fan of Chelsea Football Club[<img src='./images/chelsea.png' style="width: 1.22em;">](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) and the Los Angeles Lakers[<img src='./images/lal.png' style="width: 2em;">](https://www.nba.com/lakers/). My GOATs are Lionel Messi⚽ and LeBron James🏀 in their respective fields. In my free time, I enjoy running👟 and playing basketball🏀 a lot.
