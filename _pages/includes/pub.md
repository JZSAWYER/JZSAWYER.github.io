[PTransIPs: Identification of phosphorylation sites based on protein pretrained language model and Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05115.pdf) \\

- **Work**: PTransIPs is a deep-learning architecture to identify phosphorylation sites in host cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. It utilizes two pretrained protein models and transformer structure to make the final prediction, with transductive information maximization (TIM) loss to better evaluate the error.

- **Performance**: After comparing PTransIPs with five existing phosphorylation site prediction tools, we notice it achieves the best performance in all five model evaluation metrics (ACC, SEN, SPEC, MCC, AUC) for both S/T and Y sites. Besides, we also found that structural information might not effectively enhance the model performance on small sample dataset. 

- **Impact**: We hope that PTransIPs will aid in deepening the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation sites and look forward to enhancing PTransIPs in the future to become a more powerful tool for the scientific community.
